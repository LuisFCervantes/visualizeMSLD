# visualizeMSLD: Perform Structural Analysis with MSLD Trajectories

A simple set of functions to extract physical frames from and visualize Multi-Site Lambda Dynamics (MSLD) trajectories generated from Adaptive Landscape Flattening (ALF)<sup>1</sup>.  
  
 These functions take in many system specific variables generated by [MSLD-py-prep]("https://github.com/Vilseck-Lab/msld-py-prep/README.md")<sup>2</sup>, as well as lambda trajectory files (typically a .dat file in the ALF production analysis directory), and a .dcd MSLD trajectory file generated by CHARMM. 
  
  The output is either a PyMOL visualization of the lambda trajectory (using the transparency setting) via the `visualize_pymol` function, or, a directory called run{i}_frames containing subdirectories of each physical ligand's frames throughout the trajectory via the `grab_frames` function. Both of these functions use the output of `get_subs_on.`

These scripts can be run from within the ALF directory where the trajectory to be visualized was created.
